This python project is inspired by the fact of the saying "Make something that makes money". As a student we are struggling with paying for a cup of coffee (That reminds me of Starbucks, Yum!). Fortunately, there are rewards for clicking to ad lnks, filling out tiresome surveys and rewards for searching in the search engine like Bing(USA).

This is an automation program to auto search in Microsoft Bing. It is written in developer friendly Python 2.X in OSX (Some of the syntax may be specific to Mac OSX)

There are upto 31 credit points for searching in Desktop web, Mobile web and clicking some news links - per day. 1 point for every 2 searches. Bing rewards a $5 Amazon or Starbucks gift card for about 500 reward points. Thus this has three parts.
1. Desktop Bing search
2. Click the news links
3. Search the mobile Bing search
Note: for the mobile search in desktop I have utilized the User Agent Switcher and built my Firefox profile by setting it to iPhone. 

This python program is typically for Mozilla Firefox browser.
